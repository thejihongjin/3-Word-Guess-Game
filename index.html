## Option Two: Word Guess Game (Challenge - Recommended)
1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/W-IJcC4tYFI).
3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
4. Display the following on the page:
5. Press any key to get started!
6. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.
   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.
7. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
8. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
9. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
